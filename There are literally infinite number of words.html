There are literally an infinite number of words, this is because creation of new words happens every time so there is no upper bound on the number of words.

A study in the field of Text Mining tried to estimate the number of terms in a collection of documents and the result of it was the "Heap's Law".
- Heaps’ law: M = k(T^b)
- Here, M is the size of the vocabulary, T is the number of tokens in the collection.
- Typical values: 30 ≤ k ≤ 100 and b ≈ 0.5
- In a log-log plot of vocabulary size M vs. T, Heaps’ law predicts a line with slope about 1/2.
- It is the simplest possible relationship between the two in log-log space.

Heaps’ law suggests that
 (i) the dictionary size continues to increase with more documents in the collection, rather than a maximum vocabulary size being reached
 (ii) the size of the dictionary is quite large for large collections.
