            on Monday. There were children who rode in cars in the parade and children who
            walked behind the cars. I saw three pretty white horses walking in the parade.
            I saw some big dogs running in the parade, too. I got lots of candy from the
            clowns in the parade. The clowns had on purple hats and big, orange pants. I
            saw a clown’s puppy with a purple hat and orange pants on it, too! After the
            parade, I ate my candy and I clapped and clapped. It was a fun parade to see

        <span style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 16px;">This is a poem about many animals that live in, by and
            around you. It rhymes or repeats the sounds in the words at the end of the
            sentences. Can you tell which words rhyme or sound the same? Does “bear” and “there”
            rhyme? How about sky and lie? Have you seen some of animals that I talk about?
            Do the images of lions or tigers, worms or grasshoppers, butterflies or bees,

            other animals. Do you see that these animals are dependent on their environment
            (where they live) for food and shelter? The poem talks about bees needing
            flowers for nectar. Do you know what bees make with nectar? What do the whales
            want when they dive deep? Is there an animal you are certain likes to climb
            trees to live in for shelter? This poem is a rhyming poem about animals. It
            tells where some animals live and how they move and find food.</span></div>

        <span style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 16px;">Scientists know many things about the Sun. They know how
            old it is. The Sun is more than 4½ billion years old. That would be 109 times
            the Earth’s diameter. The Sun also weighs as much as 333,000 Earths. The Sun is
            made up of gases: 75% hydrogen and 25% helium. Hydrogen is the simplest and
            lightest of all of the known elements. When you combine hydrogen with oxygen,
            you get water. You probably know what helium is. It is the gas that can be put
            into balloons to make them stay in the air and float. Scientists also know the
            temperature of the Sun. The surface of the Sun is about 10,000 degrees
            Fahrenheit (5,600 degrees Celsius). That might sound hot, but the Sun’s core is
            even hotter. The core is the central region where the temperature reaches about
            27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million Celsius). The Sun is the center of
            our Solar System. Besides the Sun, the Solar System is made up of the planets, moons,
            asteroid belt, comets, meteors, and other objects. The Earth and other planets
            revolve around the Sun. The Sun is very important. Without it, there would be
            only darkness and our planet would be very cold and be without liquid water.
            Our planet would also be without people, animals, and plants because these
            things need sunlight and water to live. The Sun also gives out dangerous
            ultraviolet light which causes sunburn and may cause cancer. That is why you
            need to be careful of the Sun and wear sunscreen and clothing to protect
            yourself from its rays. Scientists have learned many things about the Sun. They
            study the Sun using special tools or instruments such as telescopes. One thing
            they do is to look at the amount of light from the Sun and the effect of the
            Sun’s light on the Earth’s climate. The Sun is actually a star. It is the
            closest star to the Earth. Scientists also study other stars, huge balls of
            glowing gas in the sky. There are over 200 billion stars in the sky. Some are
            much larger than the Sun and others are smaller than the Earth. They all look
            tiny because they are so far away from the Earth. This distance is measured in
            light-years, not in miles or kilometers. (One light-year is equal to the
            distance that light travels in one year. This is about six trillion miles or
            ten trillion kilometers!) Stars look like they are twinkling because when we
            see them, we are looking at them through thick layers of turbulent (moving) air
            in the Earth’s atmosphere. That is why the words are written in the song:
            Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. Stars have lifetimes of billions of years. They
            are held together by their own gravity. Over half of the stars in the sky are
            in groups of two. They orbit around the same center point and across from each
            other. There are also larger groups of stars called clusters. These clusters of
            stars make up galaxies. Our Solar System is located in the Milky Way Galaxy.</span></div>

    <div style="margin: 0px;">
        <span style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 16px;">Tara was looking forward to the science fair this Monday.
            Science was her favorite subject and someday Tara wanted to follow in her
            mother and grandmother’s footsteps to be a scientist for her future career.
            Tara had planned out her experiment about plants and followed the scientific
            rubric that her teacher, Mrs. Winston, had outlined. Last night Tara realized
            that her experiment would not work. The plants that were in the dark basement
            and were not watered seemed to be was going to happen and to hypothesize why
            something would happen. But how would Tara explain this? She needed to switch
            gears and come up with a different idea. Tara had stayed up through the night
            to do some research on plant experiments. With a little luck and some
            scientific insight, this might just work out. After a delicious breakfast of
            hot oatmeal sprinkled with brown sugar, Tara finished her freshly squeezed
            orange juice and was ready to go. The experiments needed to be set up Monday
            morning so she needed to hurry. Dusting off a large glass jar from the
            basement, Tara was headed in a new direction. “This will work out great!” Tara
            shouted as she ran up the stairs. Then she carefully placed a thin layer of
            sand followed by some black, rich dirt into the jar. She grabbed some of the
            plants that had grown well from her first experiment and tucked a few into the
            dirt. It took a little longer than she had thought because the top of the jar
            was quite narrow. Tara carefully placed the hermit crabs into the sand. They
            scrambled into their shells, a little frightened in their new environment. Tara
            filled a small container of water and placed it against some rocks. She made a
            mental note to refill the water daily so the crabs could have enough water if
            they needed some. Then she sprinkled some of the crab food powder near the
            shells. It was almost late afternoon and Tara needed to add notes to her
            scientific log. She copied the dates from the weekend into the log and wrote
            all of the details of how her first experiment did not quite work out. Then she
            wrote a summary of what her new experiment was all about. She was careful to
            follow the rubric that Mrs. Winston had reviewed. She was going to grade the
            experiments right before the science fair opened to the crowds of people who
            routinely came to view it. Tara almost forgot. She did not want anything to
            happen this time. There would be no excuse for her changing her experiment
            again. Tara placed the small section of screen she had found in the garage on
            top of the jar and tightly added a rubber band around the opening. The crabs
            would be sure to get enough air and they would be safe. She did not want
            anything to happen to the crabs. After all, they were her brother’s. She had
            hoped he wouldn’t care if she borrowed them for a few days. It was “in the name
            of science” and she thought that Ted would understand. Tara wrote about the
            terrarium she created: A terrarium is a container designed to hold small plants
            and animals in a controlled condition. (A “controlled” condition is a way of
            directing what is going to happen.) She wrote about the beach environment she
            created for the crabs. Luckily, she already knew a lot about crabs. When her
            log was completed, she placed it next to her terrarium. She was happy to be
            finished and quite pleased that her experiment worked out after all. Then she
            ran off to find Ted and to thank him for the crabs.</span></div>

    <div style="margin: 0px;">
        <span style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 16px;">Cesar Estrada Chavez (1927-1993) was a Mexican American
            labor leader who use Chavez was born in Arizona. When he was ten-year-old, his
            parents lost the family farm because of the Great Depression. They were forced
            to become migrant workers themselves. Chavez worked part-time in the farm
            fields with his family in Arizona and later in California, when his family
            lived there. After graduating from 8th grade, Chavez worked full-time to help
            support his family. He served in the U.S. Navy during WWII, married Helen
            Fabela in 1948, and eventually helped raise a family of eight children. Chavez
            and his wife helped teach Mexican immigrants to read and helped them with
            voting registration. Chavez was concerned over the health and working
            conditions of the migrant population. He did not like the use of pesticides,
            the name of the chemicals used to kill bugs on the crops. He knew that
            pesticides could make human beings sick. He organized a group of people to help
            work for the rights of farm workers. They worked on many goals like increasing
            the wages for the workers, improving their working conditions, and improving
            the safety for the farm workers. Chavez helped organize strikes, whereby the
            workers chose to stop working to protest some important issues related to work.
            For example, the migrant workers went on strike to protest the poor wages, poor
            working conditions, and lack of safety on their jobs. They refused to work
            until something changed regarding their salary and these working conditions.
            The public, that is consumers like you, sometimes chooses to support the strike
            by not buying certain products or not buying from a certain store, etc. This is
            called a boycott. Boycotts put pressure on the people who make decisions
            regarding those who are protesting and striking. Chavez went on many hunger
            strikes, too, which is another type of strike to prove a point and draw
            attention to what his concerns were. In a hunger strike, you basically do not
            eat until the demands are met. Chavez was able to use the hunger strikes to
            move legislators to change the laws to improve the lives of farm workers.
            Because of Chavez’s actions, he was jailed many times. Despite this, he
            continued his goal of helping to fight for the migrant worker. Chavez, with aid
            from Dolores Huerta and Gilbert Padilla, started a union called the National
            Farm Workers Association (NFWA) to help fight for social justice. He organized
            a national boycott of lettuce and grapes. The name NFWA was changed to the
            United Farm Workers (UFW) in 1974. In 1978, some of the demands for better
            wages and working conditions were met, so the boycott for the lettuce and
            grapes was lifted. Throughout his life, Chavez’s motto was “Si, se puede”. This
            meant, “Yes, it can be done”. Chavez proved that it could be done. His work for
            fair treatment and better pay for migrant workers helped make the lives of
            millions of people better. After a lifetime of working to help these people,
            Chavez died in 1993. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom after his
            death. Chavez’s children and grandchildren continue in his footsteps to help
            fight for the rights for migrant workers.</span></div>

        <span style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 16px;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">What is an ice
                age?</b> An ice age is a time period when the temperature of the Earth’s
            surface and atmosphere is greatly reduced so that there is a presence or
            expansion of continental ice sheets, polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers in
            the southern and northern hemispheres. Within this time period, individual
            pulses of cold climate are considered “glacial periods” and warm intermittent
            periods are called “interglacial periods”. Using the definition of glacial and
            interglacial periods, geologists classify the present condition of the world as
            an ice age that began 2.6 million years ago because the Greenland and Antarctic
            ice sheets still exist. </span></div>

                of an ice age?</b> There are three main types of evidence to consider. These
            include geological, chemical and paleontological. Geological evidence includes
            rocks, glacial moraines, drumlins, valley cutting, and the deposits of
            sediments. The chemical evidence looks at the variations in the ratios of
            isotopes in fossils found in sediments, sedimentary rocks and ocean sediment
            cores. Paleontological evidence looks at the changes in the geographical
            distribution of fossils. During cold time periods, organisms spread into lower
            latitudes and organisms that preferred warmer climates became extinct. These
            types of evidence have shown there were glacial periods over the past few
            million years. </span></div>

                history of ice ages?</b> There have been five major ice ages that chronicle the
            Earth’s past: Huronian (over 2 million years ago), Cryogenian (about 850-630
            million years ago), Andean-Saharan (about 460-420 million years ago), Karoo
            (360- 260 million years ago), and the Quaternary Ice ages (the current ice age
            starting about 2.58 million years ago). </span></div>

                during glacial time periods?</b> The climate is cooler and dryer over most of
            the Earth. Large land and sea ice masses extend outward from the poles.
            Mountain glaciers extend to lower elevations due to a lower snow line. Sea
            levels drop because large volumes of water above sea level are removed from the
            ice caps. Ocean circulation patterns are also disrupted. </span></div>

        <span style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 16px;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">What theories are
                there to explain the ice ages?</b> There are many theories behind the ice ages.
        </span></div>

    <div style="margin: 0px;">
        <span style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 16px;">• One theory is that the increase of ice and snow causes
            the earth to reflect more of the sun’s energy and absorb less energy. When air
            temperatures decrease, ice and snow fields grow. </span></div>

    <div style="margin: 0px;">
        <span style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 16px;">• Another theory hypothesizes that an ice-free Arctic
            Ocean leads to increased snowfall at high latitudes. </span></div>

    <div style="margin: 0px;">
        <span style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 16px;">• Yet, another theory surrounds the concentrations of
            carbon dioxide and methane. </span></div>

    <div style="margin: 0px;">
        <span style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 16px;">• An additional theory deals with the changes in the
            Earth’s orbit around the sun and possibly the Sun’s orbit around the galaxy. </span></div>

    <div style="margin: 0px;">
        <span style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 16px;">• Some scientists have noted that the motion of the
            tectonic plates has resulted in changes in the relative location and amount of
            continental and oceanic crust on the Earth’s surface, which in turn affects
            wind and ocean currents which may also be a cause of the ice age. </span></div>

    <div style="margin: 0px;">
        <span style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 16px;">• There is a theory about the impact of relatively large
            meteorites and another theory that volcanism, eruptions of super volcanoes, was
            a cause. </span></div>

    <div style="margin: 0px;">
        <span style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 16px;">• It is noted that several of these factors may influence
            each other. One example is when the atmospheric composition of the earth
            changes, then climate is altered. This can change the atmospheric composition
            which repeats the cycle. </span></div>

        <span style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 16px;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Will the Earth
                continue to experience glacial periods?</b> There are two known configurations
            of the continents (in existence today) that either block or reduce the warm
            water from the equator to the poles. For example, the continent of Antarctica
            sits on top of a pole and the polar Arctic Ocean is almost land-locked. These
            physical conditions lead geologists to believe that the Earth will continue to
            experience glacial periods in the near future. What are some of the effects of the
            most recent glacial period? The effects of the last glacial period are seen
            today. The moving ice impacted the landscape of Canada, Greenland, northern
            Eurasia and Antarctica. Typical features of erratic boulders, till, drumlins,
            eskers, fjords, kettle lakes, moraines, cirques, horns, etc. were left behind.
            The heavy weight of the ice deformed the Earth’s crust and mantle. Global sea
            levels dropped over 330 feet (100 meters) to expose continental shelves in some
            areas. This caused land bridges to be formed between land masses and allowed
            animals to migrate. This type of rapidly changing land has been thought to have
            caused the Baltic and Scandinavian regions, as well as much of the North
            American coastlines.</span></div>
