<pre><span class="paraIntro">Before you read, discuss in class:
Do you like homework? Do you do it yourself? Or, do you get help? What homework do you usually have? Who did Patrick's homework?</span>

<button onclick="read_it_out('paraIntro')">Read it out</button>

1.
<span class="para1">Patrick never did homework. "Too boring," he said. He played hockey, basketball, and Nintendo instead. His teachers told him, "Patrick, do your homework or you won't learn a thing." And it's true sometimes he did feel like an ignoramus but what could he do? He hated homework.</span>

<button onclick="read_it_out('para1')">Read it out</button>

2.
<span class='para2'>Then one day he found his cat playing with a little doll and he grabbed it away. To his surprise, it wasn't a doll at all, but a man of the tiniest size. He had a little wool shirt with old fashioned britches and a high tall hat much like a witch's. He yelled, "Save me, don't give me back to that cat." I'll grant you a wish, I promise you that. </span>

<button onclick="read_it_out('para2')">Read it out</button>

3.
<span class="para3">Patrick couldn't believe how lucky he was! Here was the answer to all of his problems. So he said, "only if you do all my homework till the end of the semester, that's 35 days. If you do a good enough job, I could even get A's". </span>

<button onclick="read_it_out('para3')">Read it out</button>

4.
<span class="para4">The little man's face wrinkled like a dishcloth thrown in the hamper. He kicked his legs and doubled his fists and he grimaced and scowled and pursed his lips, "Oh, am I cursed! But I'll do it."</span>

<button onclick="read_it_out('para4')">Read it out</button>

5.
<span class="para5">And true to his word, that little elf began to do Patrick's homework. Except there was one glitch. The elf did not always know what to do and he needed help. "Help me! Help me!" he'd say. And Patrick would have to help in whatever way.
"I don't know this world", the elf squeaked while reading Patrick's homework. "Get me a dictionary. No, what's even better, look up the word and sound it out by each letter."</span>

<button onclick="read_it_out('para5')">Read it out</button>

6. 
<span class="para6">When it came to Math, Patrick was out of luck. "What are times tables?" the elf shrieked. "We wish we never need that. And addition, subtraction and division and fractions? Here, sit down beside me you simply must guide me," Elves know nothing of human history, to them it's a mystery. So the little elf, already a shouter, just got louder. "Go to the library,  I need books. More and more books. And you can help me read them too."</span>

<button onclick="read_it_out('para6')">Read it out</button>

7.
<span class="para7">As a matter of fact, every day in every way that little elf was a nag! Patrick was working harder than ever and it was a drag! He was staying up nights, had never felt so weary, was going to school with his eyes puffed and bleary.</span>

<button onclick="read_it_out('para7')">Read it out</button>

8.
<span class="para8">Finally, the last day of school arrived and the elf was free to go. As for homework, there was no more, so he quietly and slyly slipped out the backdoor. </span>

<button onclick="read_it_out('para8')">Read it out</button>

9.
<span class="para9">Patrick got his A's, his classmates were amazed, his teachers smiled and were full of praise. And his parents? They wondered what had happened to Patrick. He was now the model kid. 
Cleaned his room, did his chores, was cheerful, never rude, like he had developed a whole new attitude.</span>

<button onclick="read_it_out('para9')">Read it out</button>

10.
<span class="para10">You see, in the end, Patrick still thought he'd made that tiny man do all his homework. But I'll share a secret, just between you and me. It was not the elf, Patrick had done it himself!</span>
